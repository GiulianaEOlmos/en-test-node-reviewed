<!-- Needs correcting: It's a good practice had a complete README.md in our projects. Sometines it's not easy to write a well structured one. So I added two links to use as a Guide: This one is an example of a README from an APIREST https://github.com/bbc/REST-API-example/blob/master/README.md and this one is a post about the structure https://medium.com/fbdevclagos/https-medium-com-sylvaelendu-part-6-documenting-your-api-4558cde4d44e -->
